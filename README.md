Memento
=======
Memento is an Android App that manages a simple checklist like To-Do list. It was built as my major project for my 8th semester in bachelor of engineering course of Computer Science Engineering at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra.
 
It was a team effort with me (MD Naseem Ashraf) in the lead position and doing most of the programming and UI design. It was a fun and engaging experience of learning, exploring, experimenting with Android App development as well as teaching/guiding other team members of our rag tag team comprising of Praveen Kumar, Rahul Kumar and Sumit Sagar.
 
Note:
-----
Memento works with Android Version 2.2.
MementoPrototype works with Android Version 4.2.
 
A ready to run app setup file is also bundled here as a ".apk" file.
